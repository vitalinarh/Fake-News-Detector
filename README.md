# Fake News Analysis using NLP
There should be a system which can analyse whether a given news post is fake or not, so the main purpose of this project is to build an application that can analyze fake news.

## The problem Fake News Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning techniques
Nowadays, fake news has become a common trend. Even trusted media houses are known to spread fake news and are losing their credibility. So, how can we trust any news to be real or fake? There should be a system that can analyze whether a given news post is fake or not, so the main purpose of this project is to build an application that can analyze fake news.

In this project, I have built a classifier model that can identify news as real or fake. For this purpose, a dataset from Kaggle was used (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

With the help of this project, I created an Machine Learning classifier using Random Forest classifier to detect whether the news is real or fake.

## Run the program
